Hi! I'm a fourth-year PhD Student at [IRoM Lab](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/) in [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/).

My research approaches robotics from both theoretical and practical perspectives, aiming to bridge the gap between specialist and generalist robots by understanding and improving generalization limits across perception, prediction, and reasoning. Across these domains, I derive theoretical bounds on sensor-based and language-instructed autonomy, establish safety assurances via rigorous uncertainty quantification, probe generalizability of foundation models, and derive novel uncertainty quantification methods, improving both the performance and calibration of embodied AI.

<!-- Aside from research, my interests range from [painting](https://www.pixiv.net/users/14916152/illustrations), making [art videos](https://space.bilibili.com/5651161/video), playing the piano (and guitar), to figure skating, dancing, and karate. -->
