Hi! I'm a second-year PhD Student at [IRoM Lab](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/) in [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/).

My research aims to approach robotics through a fundamental scienceâ€™s perspective. My work applies concepts and theories in information theory to quantify performance of robotic systems with arbitrary dynamics, tasks, and control strategies, given their sensing capabilities and computational constraints. I am also interested in applying these theories in the design and implementation of robotics.

Aside from research, my interests range from [painting](https://www.pixiv.net/users/14916152/illustrations), making [art videos](https://space.bilibili.com/5651161/video), playing the piano (and guitar), to figure skating, dancing, and karate.
