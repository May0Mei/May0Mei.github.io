Hi! I'm a fourth-year PhD Student at [IRoM Lab](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/) in [Princeton](https://www.princeton.edu/).

My research approaches robotics through the perspective of fundamental science and aims to address the gap between specialist and generalist robots by establishing upper and lower bounds on robotics. 

**Upper Bound:** I find fundamental limitations in robotics that plays a similar role as information theory and complexity theory. These upper bounds hold regardless of the advance of robot algorithms and therefore serve as an important guideline in improving robotics.

**Lower Bound:** With rigorous uncertainty quantification, I construct guarantees and assurances on safety and performance of specific robotics problems and generalize them to broader scenarios.

<!-- Aside from research, my interests range from [painting](https://www.pixiv.net/users/14916152/illustrations), making [art videos](https://space.bilibili.com/5651161/video), playing the piano (and guitar), to figure skating, dancing, and karate. -->
